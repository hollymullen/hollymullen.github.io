Calderbank offers – the future

In financial remedy proceedings – i.e. legal proceedings to divide the family finances following a divorce or dissolution – the general rule is that each party pays his/her own legal fees. This is enshrined in the Family Procedure Rules (FPR) part 28.3(5). However, the Court can make an order for one party to pay the other’s costs in exceptional circumstances, where it considers that that party has behaved reprehensively.

Open offers – ones not marked ‘without prejudice’ – can and are taken into consideration by a Court considering costs. However, any letter, email or telephone call which is prefaced by the above words can not be taken into account. Even ‘Calderbank offers’, which are those that are marked ‘without prejudice save as to costs’, despite their unambiguous language, cannot be considered in most family proceedings.  [[1]](#1)

This has been the position since 2006, [[2]](#2) before which time they were widely used. They are still admissible in proceedings that are subject to the Civil Procedure Rules as well as in interim maintenance applications and in appeals in family cases. [[3]](#3) The cost consequences of a Calderbank offer are that, where one is put forward and not accepted, and a judicial award is made which is equal to or more advantageous to the offeror, that party has a claim for the costs that they have incurred since making the offer. In essence, the final outcome endorses the fairness of the offer and penalises the offeree for not accepting it.

The Family Procedure Rule Committee (FPRC) – established to review the current costs regime in financial remedy cases – are inviting consultation into the functionality of the rules and a part of this will include whether to consider a revival of Calderbank offers.

The rule against considering Calderbank offers when looking into costs is controversial because the Court is obliged to consider each party’s litigation conduct – and the negotiation part is extremely relevant to this. One side could be behaving completely unreasonably: refusing to engage when a reasoned and fair offer for settlement is put forward and unnecessarily prolonging proceedings. In these cases, it seems fair that the party who put forward the offer is reimbursed for any costs incurred as a result of that offer not being accepted.

Another benefit of allowing the cost consequences of Calderbank offers is that they may act to deter a party who may be motivated to behave in the most difficult way possible simply to exacerbate tensions with their former spouse or civil partner.

Arguments in support of the current system include that the wide use of Calderbank offers forced parties to engage in a ‘form of spread betting’, [[4]](#4) in that it required someone who wished to put forward an offer to make a bet as to the likely award that a Judge may make – the outcome of a slightly lower bet possibly resulting in a windfall of costs paid. There was also concern that a costs order following a Calderbank offer could reduce the amount awarded to the paying party such that they were unable to meet their needs. Certainly, it is easy to imagine how this would skew an award which was carefully considered and calculated by the Judge on the basis of the parties’ assets as they stood after payment of their own legal costs.

Significant legal costs can be an enormous burden to bear in cases where the matrimonial pot is lacking when it comes to meeting the needs of both parties. Should the FPRC feel that the potential drawbacks could be alleviated by careful financial calculations, either before an offer is put forward by the party and their legal adviser or by Judges making allowances for costs orders and carefully considering whether making an order would affect either party’s ability to meet their needs, the re-introduction of Calderbank offers could be very welcome. The FPRC’s conclusions should be published shortly after the consultation period closes in November this year.
