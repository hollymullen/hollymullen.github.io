A Decree Nisi and Decree Absolute are each simply a single, unassuming sheet of paper but which have significant legal consequences. They are essential, chronological steps in becoming divorced. Both require an application to be made to the Court and are formally granted by a Judge of the Family Division. But what are they? Why are there two stages to pass through before becoming divorced? These are some of the questions which may be asked by someone considering, or already progressing through, a divorce.

Decree Nisi

‘Nisi’ is a Latin word meaning ‘unless’. The Decree Nisi is the first stage of the divorce and means that the Court cannot see a reason why a divorce should not be granted. 

This is obtained after the respondent to a divorce has completed their ‘Acknowledgement of Service’ (“AoS”) confirming that they have seen the divorce petition prepared by the other spouse and, usually, stating that they don’t intend to defend the divorce i.e. try to prevent it happening.

Once the Court receives the AoS they will send a copy to the person who initiated the divorce process (the “petitioner”) and that person then needs to complete the application for Decree Nisi – a simple document accompanied by a ‘Statement in Support’ which confirms that they have had sight of the AoS and wish to continue with the divorce.

After the Court processes the Decree Nisi application, they will send one of two documents to both parties. The most common of these is the ‘Certificate of Entitlement’ (“CoE”). When one of these is issued, it means that the Court approve the divorce in principle and they have fixed a date for the pronouncement of the Decree Nisi. This means that they have put a time in a Judge’s diary for him/her to formally Order the grant of the Decree Nisi. Soon after this date, a copy of the Decree will be issued to both parties. 

If the Court has been asked to make a decision as to whether the respondent should pay some or all of the costs incurred by the petitioner, they will make an Order which will be issued alongside the CoE to both parties. The respondent has until 14 days before the fixed date of the pronouncement to notify the Court that he/she wishes to object to the costs Order; they will then be required to attend Court and give evidence on that fixed date. Otherwise, there is no need for either party to attend Court on the day fixed for the pronouncement of the Decree Nisi.

The other document which can be sent by the Court after the Decree Nisi has been applied for is a ‘Notice of Refusal of Judge’s Certificate’. This means that the Court is not satisfied by something which has been stated within the application, for example if there are conflicting statements given in the petitioner’s Statement in Support contrasted with their petition for divorce. The Notice will set out exactly what further evidence, if any, is required or it may list a hearing.

For civil partnerships, the process is the same but the Decree Nisi is called a Conditional Order of Dissolution. 


Decree Absolute

A Decree Absolute is the legal document which irreversibly ends the marriage. It can be applied for by the petitioner after six weeks have passed from the date of the grant of the Decree Nisi. Again, the application is a simple one-page document that is sent off to the Court which issued the Nisi.

The Court has discretion whether or not to grant the Decree Absolute and can refuse to grant it where an application has been made by the respondent and the Court sees fit to delay the Decree so as to allow for financial provision to be made for him/her (section 10 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973). The Court also has power under the Divorce (Religious Marriages) Act 2002 to refuse to grant the Decree Absolute until arrangements for a religious divorce have been made. If either of the above do not apply, the Court can still refuse to grant the Decree Absolute at its discretion where it considers there are ‘special and exceptional’ circumstances. [[1]](#1)

If the petitioner delays in making this application, the respondent can apply for Decree Absolute from three months after the date which the petitioner was able to apply for Decree Absolute (i.e. four and a half months after the grant of the Nisi). 

Often, divorcing couples agree not to apply for the Decree Absolute until such time as an agreement has been reached regarding the matrimonial finances. Although it is possible for the Courts to make financial Orders after the grant of the Decree Absolute (although the parties are officially no longer married), it is usually preferable that the parties wait due to the effect that the Decree Absolute has on various matters such as wills and pensions. 

There may also be a delay, for example, where a spouse has a right of occupation in the former matrimonial home, which they are not a joint owner of, under the Family Law Act 1996. The Decree Absolute automatically removes any Home Rights Notices which were registered by virtue of the marriage. Furthermore, there could be a delay in the rare but possible case that the parties are considering a reconciliation. In one case, a couple obtained a Decree Nisi but reconciled and lived together for a further four years. When the petitioner applied for the Decree Absolute, it was refused and she had to start the process over again. [[2]](#2)

If the respondent decides to take matters into their own hands and make the application for Decree Absolute after the passing of three months, the Court will usually list a hearing to hear from both parties as to why the petitioner is unwilling to apply for the Decree themselves, and why the respondent wishes it to be granted (perhaps he/she wants to remarry). 

Should the petitioner apply for the Decree Absolute over one year after the grant of the Decree Nisi, they will have to annex to their application a statement explaining the delay.
When the Decree Absolute has been granted (or Dissolution Order for civil partnerships), the parties are officially divorced. The document should be kept safe as it will be required should either of them wish to remarry in the future or if they, for some other reason, need to prove that they are divorced.
