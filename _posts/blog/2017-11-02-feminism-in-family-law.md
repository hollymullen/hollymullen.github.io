Feminism is defined as the advocacy of women's rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes (Oxford English Dictionary). This piece therefore intends to explore the difficulty that the law has notoriously had, or some would argue still has, in treating the sexes equally in proceedings on divorce, separation or in children matters.
 
Going back several centuries, the inequality between men and women on divorce was flagrant and shocking. A man could be granted a divorce if his wife had committed adultery, even just once. However, a woman could not get a divorce even if her husband had been unfaithful more than once, or had many mistresses. To raise a petition, a wife would need to also prove that he was guilty of incest, bigamy or ‘unnatural vice’ (for example: sodomy, bestiality or the rape of another woman).[[1]](#1) The justification for  this inequality is unclear, but may have something to do with the ideas of shame upon a woman who has sex outside of marriage. Further damage could potentially then be caused to that woman’s reputation if she conceived a child with a lover. Adultery was seen as a crime against the male ‘owners’ of women: the law even condoning this view as it allowed a husband to sue the wife’s lover, but a woman could not do the same to any lover of her husband’s. This double standard, rather astonishingly, remained as law until 1923.[[2]](#2)
 
Attitudes in terms of women’s equality have moved forwards significantly since this. In fact, very recently came a landmark decision in the quest to have equality in family law.

Again concerning divorces; prior to 2001, non-money earners or child carers, usually wives, typically were restricted to claiming a sufficient amount to meet their needs while money earners were entitled to the remainder. There existed an assumption that the money maker was entitled to the money they had made and the non-money maker needed to show why they should have some of it. If the non-money maker wished to claim more than the value of their needs, they would need to establish that they had made an exceptional contribution. In reality, this meant that although the other partner had contributed by raising the children, thereby allowing the money earner freedom to pursue a better career, this contribution was not reflected in the financial division. However, along came the case of White v White [2001] 1 AC 596 which introduced the ‘yardstick of equality’; a notion which requires judges to use a 50-50 split as their starting point, and only depart from this if there is specific justification for doing so. The White equal sharing principle was a welcome update of the law with modern values. It represented the recognition by the law of the different sorts of value each party brings to marriage, and also that marriages involve a partnership based on shared lives and finances.
 
Today, it could be argued that there are very few discriminatory features in Family Law. Munby LJ recently stated that ‘men and women come before the family courts... on an exactly equal footing. The voice of the father carries no more weight because he is the father, nor does the mother’s because she is the mother.’ [[3]](#3)
 
There remain, however, some features which give commentators pause for thought on the question of whether men and women are truly equals in Family Law. These features include the notions of parenthood and parental responsibility, which are concepts which the law uses to define, firstly, who is a parent, and secondly, who is responsible for the care of the child. The latter usually goes hand-in-hand with the former, so for the purposes of the following text it is pertinent to presume that all legal parents also have parental responsibility.
 
With mothers, parentage is proven demonstrably by parturition,[[4]](#4) i.e. the woman who carried the child is the legal mother[[5]](#5) and the law no longer defines a mother as the woman who provided the egg. In this way, it is easy to find out who is, in law, the mother of a child and this is rarely a matter for heavy debate. For fathers, however, the issue is not so straightforward. A father is defined as the man who provided the sperm (except if he were a donor through a licensed clinic);[[6]](#6) which is not always as immediately obvious upon the birth of the child. Instead, the law relies on presumptions which is an imperfect system. If the mother is married, the law will presume that the husband is the father. Similarly, it will presume that any man named on the birth certificate is the father or any man who has obtained a signed parental responsibility agreement for the child. The latter are rare, and the pattern of some mothers failing to name a father on the birth certificate can mean that children lack a legal father.
 
The repercussions of this inequality can sometimes be frustrating, upsetting or inconvenient for unmarried fathers. Without parental responsibility, they may be unable to take the child out of the country without the express permission of the mother, or may similarly be unable to consent to medical procedures. Many fathers may be unaware that they do not have parental responsibility for their child. Some commentators would go so far as to argue that the laws of paternity favour mothers over fathers - certainly, some judges appear to support this when they can be quoted saying such things as ‘mothers are special’.[[7]](#7) Although the unfairness here is glaring, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that it is not discriminatory against unmarried fathers due to the various levels of commitment which these different fathers may offer their children, from ‘ignorance and indifference at one end of the spectrum to a close stable relationship’.[[8]](#8)
                         
All in all, there have been gross inequalities between the respective treatment of men and women in Family Law. In an ideal world, mothers and fathers and husbands and wives would automatically be accorded the same rights and there would be no question about this. Unfortunately, global views about the respective roles of men and women still has echoes in today's law. Women having been viewed as the ‘property’ of their husbands and men having been viewed as money-earners, their fatherhood status less important as their role was to financially support the family, has had an effect which is difficult to shift. Things, however, do appear to be moving in the right direction with significant decisions such as that of White v White. Although feminists have had a difficult battle in advancing women’s rights within this area of the law, there is certainly a much fairer, yet still imperfect, system today.
