The case

K v L and another [2019] EWFC 21 is a decision of the Family Court made on 7 February 2019 by Theis J. The case concerned a child born by surrogacy in 2017 and it was before the Court on an application made by the child’s ‘intended parents’ i.e. a same sex male couple known as K and L who had entered into a surrogacy arrangement with P, the gestational mother. 

The background to the case was that K and L decided that they wanted a child and contacted a surrogacy agency based in Canada. A surrogacy agreement was drawn up with P and signed by all parties. The embryo placed in P was created with K’s gametes and a donor egg. The child, N, was born in Canada in 2017 and soon after returned to the UK with K and L to their family home in London. 

K and L wasted no time in seeking a parental order, which was applied for in March 2018. A child arrangement order was made which granted them each parental responsibility for N - something that fathers who are married to the birth mother or whose names are written on the child’s birth certificate acquire automatically.

Unfortunately, K and L’s relationship broke down soon after this and they separated in August 2018 after disagreements arose over N’s care.

The parties managed to agree the arrangements for N to spend time with each of them and the Court approved that arrangement. What the Court had to make a ruling on was whether K and L should be granted a parental order – an order which has the effect of removing the legal status of the birth mother and giving full parental status instead to K and L.

One issue before the Court was that the law is framed in such a way as to only allow these applications where there are two applicants who are married, in a civil partnership or in an enduring family relationship with each other. [[1]](#1) The Judge was able to read this section, however, in a way that would not prevent K and L obtaining this order despite their separation, which clearly meant they were no longer in an enduring family relationship, as this status does not necessarily need to exist at the time of the making of the order. Contrastingly, at the time the application was made, they were in what the Judge described as ‘a settled relationship’ – they had been together for over 4 years, they lived together and had ‘jointly embarked on the surrogacy arrangement’.

Another would-be pitfall arose as the law also requires that the child’s home is with the applicants. [[2]](#2) This time, the section explicitly states that this must be at the time of the application and when the order is made. Of course, as K and L were separated, what did this mean for where N’s home was said to be? The Judge, again, interpreted this section flexibly and found that N’s home was with K and L, albeit in separate physical properties.

In making the parental order, the Judge looked to the spirit of the law and the intentions of Parliament in her judgement. She stated that the aim was ‘to allow an order to be made which has a transformative effect on the legal relationship between the child and the applicants’. She also made reference to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights – the right to respect for private and family life. She expressed her finding that, if she were to not make a parental order in this case, this would be an interference with N, K and L’s private and family lives in that N ‘would be denied the social and emotional benefits of recognition of that relationship’.

The Judge, of course, had to consider whether making this order would meet N’s lifelong welfare needs. She decided that it would. N had had no contact with her birth mother and, as such, to replace the legal status of the birth mother with that of K and L was in her best interest.

The future

This case provides peace of mind for same sex male couples who decide to have a child by surrogacy. Regardless of whether they were, like K and L, in a ‘cohabiting’ relationship, married or in a civil partnership, it appears that this decision would extend and apply in all three circumstances if there is a divorce/dissolution or separation before a parental order has been made. 

Overall, if the couple do decide to split up before obtaining a parental order, following K v L, they will not be prevented from acquiring the legal status which safeguards their human rights and recognises that the two of them being the child’s only legal parents (rather than the surrogate mother) is the best thing for that child’s lifelong welfare. 

This case is hugely encouraging in its support for the changing family dynamics that exist in today’s society. It provides judicial recognition that two fathers, separated or not, can obviously make excellent parents.
