Upon marriage, the marriage certificate or civil partnership certificate is evidence of a change of name. For women who wish to adopt their new husband’s surname, they do not have to do so by deed poll. They can simply apply for a new passport and change their name with banks and the DVLA etc. by producing the marriage certificate and asking to be known by their new husband’s surname. 

For husbands who wish to change to their new wife’s surname, or for those who are double-barrelling their surnames, it may be necessary to do so by deed poll. 

On the flip side, the rules are similar for divorce. It is a common misconception that a Decree Absolute (the document which is legal proof of the divorce and replaces the marriage certificate) automatically reverts any changes of name on marriage to what they were previously without the person having to do anything. To change back to a maiden name, or single barrelled name etc, it is necessary to undertake the same process as above by sending off the Decree Absolute with any requests to change back to the person’s previous name. It is also an option to do so by deed poll, if that is preferred.

There are additional requirements for changing a name upon divorce that make it more difficult than upon marriage. To obtain a passport in a previous name, the Government will also require the following to be submitted:

* birth certificate
* signed statement providing that there is an intention to revert to a previous surname ‘for all purposes’
* a document that shows use of the new name (for example a payslip, or a letter from the local council)
* the Decree Absolute; and
* the marriage or civil partnership certificate showing both names [[1]](#1)

The latter is a difficult requirement as, once the original marriage certificate is sent to the court alongside the application for divorce, it is not returned. Therefore, if the passport office insist on this being included, it would fall upon the person applying to also order a further copy from the General Registry Office.

This may seem onerous and bizarre, however the reason why the Decree Absolute on its own is insufficient is because it does not reference the previous/maiden name, only the married one. On the other hand, the marriage certificate does show the previous name and also includes the other party’s surname so that it is clear what the married name would be. Prior to 1971, Decree Absolutes included both names and so would have been sufficient evidence on their own to revert the name. [[2]](#2)

In most cases, couples are advised to delay obtaining a Decree Absolute until the finanecs are settled. If one party does not wish to wait until this is obtained, they have the option of changing their name by deed poll prior to this time. Furthermore, some organisations will accept the Decree Nisi (the initial stage of the divorce and not a final declaration that the marriage is dissolved) as sufficient evidence for the change of name – such as the DVLA. HM Passport office will not.

To change to a name that was not the name had prior to the marriage, it is necessary to do so by deed poll.
