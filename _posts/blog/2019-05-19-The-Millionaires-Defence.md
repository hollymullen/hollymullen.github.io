In financial proceedings on divorce, claims for financial provision for children after separation, and civil claims against former cohabitees under the Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996, there is a requirement for both parties to provide disclosure as to their financial circumstances. The duty is to provide ‘full and frank’ disclosure, and it is owed to the Court which means that a Judge hearing the case, if they feel that one party has not complied, can make orders requiring them to provide further disclosure and can even back these orders with something called a ‘penal notice’. This is a formal warning to that person that, if they do not comply with the order, they will be in contempt of court and can be punished with a fine or even imprisonment. The Court can also penalise that person by ordering them to pay costs incurred by the other party e.g. in chasing for the disclosure and making the application for the penal notice.

It is surprising, therefore, to note the number of cases which are heard in the Courts of England & Wales involving a spouse/civil partner/cohabitee who has failed to provide full and frank disclosure. 

A novel argument that some have put forward to avoid the need for disclosure altogether is the ‘Millionaire’s defence’. Rarely used and probably unlikely to go down well with most Judges, it nonetheless allows a party to claim that he/she need not give detailed disclosure on the basis that he/she is so wealthy that any reasonable order the Court chose to make would be affordable. It is easy to imagine many flaws in this. The first being that the Court would be in difficulty knowing where to begin to make an order, without knowing the assets in the case. It is possible that the Court could rely on an asset schedule presented by the other party – including estimated figures for the non-disclosing party’s assets which are unsupported by evidence. It is likely that the Court would be hesitant to rely on this, however, and have concerns that any order made would simply be appealed or brought back for enforcement proceedings when it is not complied with.

Regardless of this, some cases report that orders have been made on this basis. In AH v PH (Scandinavian Marriage Settlement) [2013] EWHC 3873 (Fam), the court stated that, provided the respondent gives a broad outline of his overall wealth, this defence is appropriate in cases where the sharing principle would not apply. This means cases that are based on need alone and the Court can make an order which allows both parties’ needs to be met from the outlined assets without delving too deeply into what exactly those are so that they can be shared. 

A more recent case also involved the millionaire’s defence in a Schedule 1 Children Act claim and was reported as G v S [2017] EWHC 365. In this case, a mother sought funds to house herself and the children from the father, who was a US national of Swedish origin and described as a ‘scion of one of the best-known and wealthiest families in Sweden’. His position was that he could meet any order that the Court may make and therefore provided minimal disclosure. He received income from two substantial trusts which, in one year, was £2.75 million net. The mother also alleged that the father had recently received an enormous inheritance of £350 million. She stated that the order sought of £2.1 million was, therefore, well within his means. The parties were able to agree and settle on this basis.

The defence, therefore, might be used in cases where there has been a short marriage or where the assets are mainly non-matrimonial, provided that the Court feels it would be appropriate and proportionate.
