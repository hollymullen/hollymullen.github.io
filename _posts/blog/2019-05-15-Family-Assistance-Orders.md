A family assistance order (“FAO”) is a formal court order under section 16 of the Children Act 1989 and is usually made in contested applications for Child Arrangement Orders (“CAO”). An FAO requires a CAFCASS or local authority officer, usually one who is familiar with the case, perhaps involved previously to file a safeguarding letter or section 7 report, to advise, assist and (where appropriate) befriend the family to support them howsoever required. 

This can be useful where one of the parties has applied for contact with the children and, for whatever reason, contact cannot be arranged directly between the parties – perhaps the children have decided that they do not want to see the applicant, and the other party has done all that they can to encourage them with no success. The appointed family assistance officer may be able to provide the third party intervention that is needed to get to the bottom of the children’s’ perceptions and advise the Court on the most appropriate action to take to progress the contact.

FAOs can only be made alongside another order – the Family Procedure Rules do not provide for one to be specifically applied for in itself. Therefore, a party must request that the Court, when making a CAO or other order, also makes an FAO. Practice Direction 12M to the Family Procedure Rules, at paragraph 1.2, provides that the court must, before making an FAO, obtain the opinion of the appropriate officer about whether making one would be in the best interests of the child concerned. All parties (other than the child/children concerned) must consent to the making of the order. 

An FAO cannot be for an indefinite period and the maximum time frame that one can be in force for is 12 months.

CAFCASS have published guidance as to when an FAO may be of benefit. [[1]](#1_) This guidance provides that the following considerations must be made:

* Involvement in the case must be necessary to enable a good outcome for the child;
* Of all of the options available to the Court, an FAO must be considered to be the only way to achieve the intended outcome; and
* Whether the intended outcome is achievable through specific targeted work, which is affordable within available resources.

CAFCASS will also consider whether there are any additional vulnerabilities in the case such as learning disabilities or mental health issues which require additional support in order to achieve progress.

An FAO clearly provides an additional burden on public services, particularly where an officer with a busy caseload is required to frequently meet with the parties and/or children over a 12 month period. Often, therefore, the preference is, at least initially, to explore alternative options such as family therapy or other psychological intervention.
