Animals have rights. Our domesticated pets, animals used in agriculture or farming and even wild animals are gaining more rights as activists fiercely campaign against newly emerging cases of animals’ neglect and mistreatment. Is it fair, then, that upon divorce or separation, pets are treated by the law as mere chattels; personal property without their own rights or considerations?

There are plenty of news stories quoting that celebrities have split and gone to Court over who gets the family dog – most recently and notably was Ant McPartlin and his ex-wife. They eventually agreed to share care of their five-year-old Labrador after months of litigation. This is not an unusual story. It isn’t difficult to imagine former couples with plenty of money and hordes of bitterness to fight tooth and nail over possession of the family pet – even just to ‘get one over’ on the other person. But what actually happens when it does go to Court?

A Court is able to make a financial order upon a divorce when an application is made by one spouse. The Court’s powers are wide and include the ability to make orders for ongoing maintenance of one spouse by another, orders for the sale of property and orders for the transfer of assets into one spouse’s sole name.

In children applications where there is a dispute about who should care for the children, the Court’s primary consideration is that child or children’s welfare. Consideration is given to the child’s basic and more complex needs and the Court will closely look at the ability of both parents to meet those needs. A Court’s duty to ensure that the child’s welfare is paramount includes an assessment of who may provide a greater quality of care to that child.

Financial and children applications are completely distinct. Where parties cannot agree who keeps the family dog, cat, iguana or other pet this can be considered within the financial proceedings if one party makes an application for this to be decided by the Court. Unlike upon a children application, there is no checklist of factors to be considered or welfare concerns involved in the Court’s decision. The pet is simply an item of personal property and either party could be awarded it as part of a settlement ruling – although the Court will strongly encourage the parties to agree between themselves as the costs of going to Court over who gets the pet can be disproportionate.

Whereas it would, of course, be counter-intuitive (and rather ridiculous) in terms of proportionality and costs to suggest that domestic pet disputes should be treated in the same way as Courts deal with children matters – there could be some points to take to ensure fairness. Shouldn’t the parties ability to meet the pet’s needs be given some consideration? What if one of them always remembers to give Fluffy the cat his medicine and the other one doesn’t even know how to? It could be argued that the pet would be better off being with one rather than the other.

Having said that, for this to be a required consideration of the Court would mean that there would need to be hearings; the parties to give evidence as to their abilities to care for the pet and perhaps even evidence from the local vet practice. It all becomes rather comical and silly when considered alongside the thousands of pounds that would potentially be spent on legal fees.

In the USA, recourse is often had to who purchased the pet in the first place. Assets that were brought into the marriage as opposed to purchased during it is a consideration of the UK courts too, however, if this was disputed then the person alleging that they paid the initial cost of the pet would need to produce evidence in the form of a receipt or bank statement showing the payment made. Even then, the Court would not be obliged to order that that person retain the pet purely because they paid the initial cost.

In all, our pets are a huge part of our lives and it can be devastating to imagine a life without them. On divorce, it is hoped that the parties can agree arrangements that are most beneficial for the pet and not simply what would upset the other person most.
