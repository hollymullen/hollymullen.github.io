What is a child maintenance calculation

The Child Support Act (“CSA”) 1991 at section 11 states that ‘each parent of a qualifying child is responsible for maintaining him.’ The exact circumstances when maintenance is payable are explored below. Overall, a maintenance calculation is what is required when parents, for whatever reason, cannot reach an agreement themselves or wish to work out whether an amount they are being offered is less than they are entitled to receive by way of support.

In these circumstances, a calculation can be sought from the current body which administers child maintenance, the Child Maintenance Service (“CMS”) – formerly the Child Support Agency. The calculations and all of the governing law is found in the Child Support Act 1991. Whilst the CMS strongly encourages private arrangements between parents, and provides online resources to assist with this, it will receive applications and can also assist with collecting and distributing the payments made.

To make an application to the CMS, a £20 fee is required, which is waived where the applicant is under 18 or is a victim of domestic abuse. Further, if the person applying wants the CMS to collect the maintenance and pay it straight to them, there is a fee for this service. The fee is charged by requiring the paying parent to pay an extra 20% on top of the maintenance calculation and then the receiving parent loses 4% of the maintenance in a further fee. Although this seems a large additional expense, the Department of Work and Pensions has found that the fees are influential in encouraging parents to collaborate. [[1]](#1)

If the paying parent does not pay, the CMS has a wide range of powers to ensure compliance such as arranging for the paying parent’s employer to deduct the sum payable and send it to the CMS before paying them their salary. However, the receiving parent cannot take any steps to enforce the calculation made and must leave this in the hands of the CMS.

When is it Payable

Child maintenance is only payable where two parents are separated. The CMS will not make a calculation if the parents are still living together. There also is no child maintenance payable if both parents share the care of the children exactly equally.

Who must pay

The parent who is not living in the same household as the child (“the non-resident parent”) is the one who is responsible for making maintenance payments to the other.

The CMS only has jurisdiction to make a maintenance calculation in respect of the biological or adoptive parent of the child/children. Further, they have no jurisdiction where either parent is not habitually resident in the UK. In cases involving step-children or parents who live overseas, it is possible to make an application to a Family Court for an order requiring periodical payments to be made instead.

If there is a dispute about who is the parent of the child, the CMS may refuse to make a calculation until a Court has determined the issue.

How the calculation is reached

Calculations made by the CMS are based upon the gross income of the non-resident parent and the CMS will obtain this information from HMRC, the non-resident parent’s employer or, if necessary, from the parent themselves. If either parent withholds any information from the CMS, they may commit a criminal offence. [[2]](#2)

The non-resident parent will, depending upon their income, pay maintenance at one of four prescribed rates: the basic rate, the reduced rate, the flat rate or the nil rate. There is no minimum level of income, and even those earning £7 or below gross per week will be liable to a calculation, albeit at the nil rate so that nothing is payable. Further, even persons in receipt of benefits will have to pay a set amount in maintenance for any children that they do not live with. There is a maximum income where anything over a set amount is ignored – currently this is set at anything over £3,000 gross per week (£156,000pa). If the non-resident parent earns over this amount, however, it is open for the other parent to apply to Court for a ‘top up’ order to increase the maintenance payable. [[3]](#3)

Reductions where there are other children

The non-resident parent may also have other children that they do not live with, in which case they could be subject to two different maintenance calculations. In this circumstance, the CMS will apportion any maintenance due by dividing it by the number of children and then sharing it between the parents who have the day-to-day care of those children. [[4]](#4)

If the non-resident parent is living with a new partner and their children, and they or the new partner claim child benefit for those children, a reduction is applied to the calculation even though he/she is not the biological parent of those children. The effect of this is to reduce the paying parent’s income by 11%, 14% or 16% depending on the number of children that they are now living with.

How long is it payable for?

Under the current CMS scheme, which has been in place since 2012, child maintenance is payable until the child is aged 16 or, if they are in full-time secondary education, age 20. 

The CMS, rather than the Court, have almost exclusive jurisdiction over child maintenance matters, [[5]](#5) but a Court can make an order for child maintenance in some limited circumstances, such as where a written agreement between the parties is submitted for endorsement by the Court. [[6]](#6) Where a Court makes such an order, there are different rules regarding how long maintenance can be payable for. If the Court is making an order following a divorce under the Matrimonial Causes Act (“MCA”) 1973, it can only require payments to be made until the child’s 17th birthday, unless it is in the child’s interest for it to continue until he/she is 18 - such as if they are in full-time education. [[7]](#7)  A Court can make an order to last beyond age 18 only in special circumstances such as if the child has a disability or if they are to continue further education. [[8]](#8)

It is worth noting that the making of a Court order does not necessarily preclude a parent from applying for a CMS calculation. The consent order was made before 3 March 2003, no application can be made to the CMS whilst that order remains in force. If it was made after this time, an application may be made to the CMS after one year. [[9]](#9)

The multitude of different rules can be bamboozling and there are also considerations to be made as to whether receiving maintenance will reduce entitlement to benefits. 

I would recommend visiting the advice pages on the government’s website and Citizen’s Advice, and in particular the gov.uk online child maintenance calculator.
